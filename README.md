**An open protocol enabling communication and interoperability between opaque agentic applications.**

The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol addresses a critical challenge in the AI landscape: enabling gen AI agents, built on diverse frameworks by different companies running on separate servers, to communicate and collaborate effectively - as agents, not just as tools. A2A aims to provide a common language for agents, fostering a more interconnected, powerful, and innovative AI ecosystem.

With A2A, agents can:

- Discover each other's capabilities.
- Negotiate interaction modalities (text, forms, media).
- Securely collaborate on long running tasks.
- Operate without exposing their internal state, memory, or tools.

## Conceptual Overview

The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol facilitates communication between independent AI agents. Here are the core concepts:

- **Agent Card:** A public metadata file (usually at `/.well-known/agent.json`) describing an agent's capabilities, skills, endpoint URL, and authentication requirements. Clients use this for discovery.
- **A2A Server:** An agent exposing an HTTP endpoint that implements the A2A protocol methods (defined in the [json specification](/specification)). It receives requests and manages task execution.
- **A2A Client:** An application or another agent that consumes A2A services. It sends requests (like `tasks/send`) to an A2A Server's URL.
- **Task:** The central unit of work. A client initiates a task by sending a message (`tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`). Tasks have unique IDs and progress through states (`submitted`, `working`, `input-required`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).
- **Message:** Represents communication turns between the client (`role: "user"`) and the agent (`role: "agent"`). Messages contain `Parts`.
- **Part:** The fundamental content unit within a `Message` or `Artifact`. Can be `TextPart`, `FilePart` (with inline bytes or a URI), or `DataPart` (for structured JSON, e.g., forms).
- **Artifact:** Represents outputs generated by the agent during a task (e.g., generated files, final structured data). Artifacts also contain `Parts`.
- **Streaming:** For long-running tasks, servers supporting the `streaming` capability can use `tasks/sendSubscribe`. The client receives Server-Sent Events (SSE) containing `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` messages, providing real-time progress.
- **Push Notifications:** Servers supporting `pushNotifications` can proactively send task updates to a client-provided webhook URL, configured via `tasks/pushNotification/set`.

### Typical Flow

1.  **Discovery:** Client fetches the Agent Card from the server's well-known URL.
2.  **Initiation:** Client sends a `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe` request containing the initial user message and a unique Task ID.
3.  **Processing:**
    - **(Streaming):** Server sends SSE events (status updates, artifacts) as the task progresses.
    - **(Non-Streaming):** Server processes the task synchronously and returns the final `Task` object in the response.
4.  **Interaction (Optional):** If the task enters `input-required`, the client sends subsequent messages using the same Task ID via `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`.
5.  **Completion:** The task eventually reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).

## Why A2A?

As AI agents become more prevalent, their ability to interoperate is crucial for building complex, multi-functional applications. A2A aims to:

- **Break Down Silos:** Connect agents across different ecosystems.
- **Enable Complex Collaboration:** Allow specialized agents to work together on tasks that a single agent cannot handle alone.
- **Promote Open Standards:** Foster a community-driven approach to agent communication, encouraging innovation and broad adoption.
- **Preserve Opacity:** Allow agents to collaborate without needing to share internal memory, proprietary logic, or specific tool implementations, enhancing security and protecting intellectual property.

### Key Features

- **Standardized Communication:** JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S).
- **Agent Discovery:** Via "Agent Cards" detailing capabilities and connection info.
- **Flexible Interaction:** Supports synchronous request/response, streaming (SSE), and asynchronous push notifications.
- **Rich Data Exchange:** Handles text, files, and structured JSON data.
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Designed with security, authentication, and observability in mind.
