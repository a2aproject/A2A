## Implementation Details

### JSON-RPC Implementation
The A2A-MCP connector uses the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol for all MCP tool communication:

1. **JSON-RPC Request Creation**: 
   - All requests follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
   - Unique request IDs are generated for each request
   - The standard `execute` method is used for tool execution

2. **Response Handling**:
   - Responses are validated against the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
   - Error responses are properly parsed and handled
   - Response IDs are verified to match request IDs

3. **Utilities**:
   - The `jsonrpc_utils.py` module provides helper functions for JSON-RPC operations
   - Standard error codes and message formats are implemented

### Testing Tools
Several testing tools are provided to help validate your MCP tools:

1. **JSON-RPC Test Script** (`test_jsonrpc.py`):
   - Tests direct communication with MCP tools
   - Validates JSON-RPC compliance
   - Provides detailed feedback on response format

2. **Mock MCP Server** (`mock_mcp_server.py`):
   - Implements a simple MCP tool with JSON-RPC support
   - Useful for testing the connector without external dependencies
   - Can be extended for more complex testing scenarios

3. **End-to-End Test** (`test_e2e.py`):
   - Tests the complete flow from connector to MCP tool and back
   - Simulates registration and tool calling
   - Validates the entire integration
