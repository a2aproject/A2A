# Python Quickstart Tutorial: Building an A2A Agent with the SDK

Welcome to the Agent2Agent (A2A) Python Quickstart Tutorial!

In this tutorial, you will build A2A-compliant agents using Python. We'll start with a simple "HelloWorld" agent to introduce you to the fundamental concepts and components of an A2A server. You will then progressively explore more advanced features, culminating in an agent powered by the LangGraph framework that interacts with external APIs.

This hands-on guide will help you understand:

- The basic concepts behind the A2A protocol.
- How to set up a Python project for A2A development using the SDK.
- How to define Agent Skills and create an Agent Card.
- How to implement an A2A server that handles tasks, using the SDK's `AgentExecutor` and `A2AServer` components.
- How to interact with your A2A server using the `A2AClient`.
- How to incorporate streaming capabilities for real-time updates.
- How to integrate a more complex agent framework like LangGraph to build a functional agent.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a functional A2A agent built with the Python SDK and a solid foundation for building more complex A2A-compliant applications.
