# A2A Extensions

A2A supports extending the protocol with custom extensions, allowing for customized functionality beyond the core protocol definition. Extensions are defined via an **extension profile document**. This document should contain the specification of the extension, including:

- How the extension impacts requests to the server
- How the extension impacts responses from the server
- The meaning of and use of configuration parameters exposed in the `AgentCard`


Extensions can be hosted anywhere and do not require any approval from the A2A maintainers.
