# Life of a Task

In the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, interactions can be simple, stateless
exchanges or complex, long-running processes. When a client sends a message to an
agent, the agent can respond in one of two ways:

*   **Message**: The agent replies with a stateless `Message`. In this
    case, the interaction is typically complete.
*   **Task**: The agent initiates a stateful `Task`. In this case, the agent
    processes the task through a defined lifecycle. It communicates progress and
    requires input as needed, until the task reaches an interrupted state (for
    example, `input-required`, `auth-required`) or a terminal state (for example,
    `completed`, `canceled`, `rejected`, `failed`).

## Grouping Related Interactions

A `contextId` is a crucial identifier that logically groups multiple `Task`
objects and independent `Message` objects, providing continuity across a series
of interactions.

*   When a client sends a message for the first time, the agent can respond
    with a new `contextId`. If a task is initiated, it will also have a `taskId`.
*   Clients can send subsequent messages and include the same `contextId` to
    indicate that they are continuing their previous interaction within the same
    context.
*   Clients can optionally attach the `taskId` to a subsequent message to
    indicate that the message is a continuation of that specific task.

The `contextId` enables collaboration towards a common goal or shared
contextual session across multiple, potentially concurrent, tasks. Internally,
an A2A agent (especially one using an LLM) can leverage the `contextId` to
manage its internal conversational state or LLM context.

## Agent Response: Message or Task

The choice between responding with a `Message` or a `Task` depends on the
nature of the interaction and the agent's capabilities:

*   **Messages for trivial interactions**: `Message` objects are suitable for
    transactional interactions that do not require long-running
    processing or complex state management. An agent might use messages to
    negotiate the acceptance or scope of a task before committing to a `Task`
    object.
*   **Tasks for stateful workflows**: Once an agent maps the intent of an
    incoming message to a supported capability that requires substantial,
    trackable work over an extended period, the agent responds with a `Task`
    object.

Conceptually, agents can operate at different levels of complexity:

*   **Message-only agents**: Always respond with `Message` objects. They
    typically don't manage complex state or long-running executions, and use
    `contextId` to tie messages together. These agents might directly wrap LLM
    invocations and simple tools.
*   **Task-generating agents**: Always respond with `Task` objects, even for
    responses, which are then modeled as completed tasks. Once a task is
    created, the agent will only return `Task` objects in response to messages
    sent, and once a task is complete, no more messages can be sent. This
    approach simplifies consistency and tracking.
*   **Hybrid agents**: Generate both `Message` and `Task` objects. These agents
    use messages to negotiate agent capability and the scope of work for a task,
    then send a `Task` object to track execution and manage states like
    `input-required` or error handling. Once a task is created, the agent will
    only return `Task` objects in response to messages sent, and once a task is
    complete, no more messages can be sent. A hybrid agent can use messages to
    negotiate the scope of a task, and then generate a task to track its
    execution.

## Task Refinements

Clients often need to send new requests based on task results or refine previous
task outputs. This is modeled by starting another interaction using the same
`contextId` as the original task. Clients can further hint the agent by
providing references to the original task using `referenceTaskIds` in the
`Message` object. The agent then responds with either a new `Task` or a
`Message`.

## Task Immutability

Once a task reaches a terminal state (completed, canceled, rejected, or failed),
it cannot restart. Any subsequent interaction related to that task, such as a
refinement, must initiate a new task within the same `contextId`. This principle
offers several benefits:

*   Clients can reliably reference tasks and their associated state, artifacts,
    and messages, providing a clean mapping of inputs to outputs. This is
    valuable for orchestration and traceability.
*   Every new request, refinement, or follow-up becomes a distinct task. This
    simplifies bookkeeping, allows for granular tracking of an agent's work, and
    enables tracing each artifact to a specific task.
*   Removes ambiguity for agent developers regarding whether to create a new task
    or restart an existing one.

## Parallel Follow-ups

A2A supports parallel work by enabling agents to create distinct, parallel
tasks for each follow-up message sent within the same `contextId`. This allows
clients to track individual tasks and create new dependent tasks as soon as a
prerequisite task is complete.

For example:

*   Task 1: Book a flight to Helsinki.
*   Task 2: Based on Task 1, book a hotel.
*   Task 3: Based on Task 1, book a snowmobile activity.
*   Task 4: Based on Task 2, add a spa reservation to the hotel booking.

## Referencing Previous Artifacts

The serving agent infers the relevant artifact from a referenced task or from the
`contextId`. As the domain expert, the serving agent is best suited to resolve
ambiguity or identify missing information. If there is ambiguity, the agent asks
the client for clarification by returning an `input-required` state. The client
can then specify the artifact in its response, optionally populating artifact
references (`artifactId`, `taskId`) in `Part` metadata.

## Tracking Artifact Mutation

A follow-up or refinement can result in an older artifact being modified or
newer artifacts being generated. Although the A2A protocol doesn't directly
manage a linked list of artifact mutations, clients can maintain this linkage to
track the latest version of a task result. This allows clients to decide what
they consider an acceptable result and ensures they are using the most up-to-date
information. To aid this, serving agents should maintain the same artifact name
when generating a refinement on an original artifact.

## Example Follow-up Scenario

The following example illustrates a typical task flow with a follow-up:

1.  Client sends message to agent:

    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "req-001",
      "method": "message.send",
      "params": {
        "message": {
          "role": "user",
          "parts": [
            {
              "kind": "text",
              "text": "Generate an image of a sailboat on the ocean."
            }
          ]
          "messageId": "msg-user-001"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2.  Agent responds with boat image (completed task):

    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "req-001",
      "result": {
        "id": "task-boat-gen-123",
        "contextId": "ctx-conversation-abc",
        "status": {
          "state": "completed"
        },
        "artifacts": [
          {
            "artifactId": "artifact-boat-v1-xyz",
            "name": "sailboat_image.png",
            "description": "A generated image of a sailboat on the ocean.",
            "parts": [
              {
                "kind": "file",
                "file": {
                  "name": "sailboat_image.png",
                  "mimeType": "image/png",
                  "bytes": "base64_encoded_png_data_of_a_sailboat"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "kind": "task"
      }
    }
    ```

    Replace the following:

*   `req-001`, `req-002`: Request IDs.
*   `msg-user-001`, `msg-user-002`: Message IDs.
*   `ctx-conversation-abc`: Context ID.
*   `task-boat-gen-123`, `task-boat-color-456`: Task IDs.
*   `artifact-boat-v1-xyz`, `artifact-boat-v2-red-pqr`: Artifact IDs.
*   `base64_encoded_png_data_of_a_sailboat`, `base64_encoded_png_data_of_a_RED_sailboat`: Base64 encoded image data.

3.  Client asks to color the boat red (refinement): This request refers to the previous
    `taskId` and uses the same `contextId`.

    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "req-002",
      "method": "message.send",
      "params": {
        "message": {
          "role": "user",
          "messageId": "msg-user-002",
          "contextId": "ctx-conversation-abc",
          "referenceTaskIds": [
            "task-boat-gen-123"
          ],
          "parts": [
            {
              "kind": "text",
              "text": "That's great! Can you make the sailboat red?"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

4.  Agent responds with new image artifact (new task, same context, updated
    artifact name): The agent creates a new task within the same `contextId`. The
    new boat image artifact retains the same name but has a new `artifactId`.

    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "req-002",
      "result": {
        "id": "task-boat-color-456",
        "contextId": "ctx-conversation-abc",
        "status": {
          "state": "completed"
        },
        "artifacts": [
          {
            "artifactId": "artifact-boat-v2-red-pqr",
            "name": "sailboat_image.png",
            "description": "A generated image of a red sailboat on the ocean.",
            "parts": [
              {
                "kind": "file",
                "file": {
                  "name": "sailboat_image.png",
                  "mimeType": "image/png",
                  "bytes": "base64_encoded_png_data_of_a_RED_sailboat"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "kind": "task"
      }
    }
    ```
