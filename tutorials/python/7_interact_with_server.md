# Interacting With Your A2A Server

First we'll use Google-A2A's cli tool to send requests to our A2A server. After trying it out, we'll write our own basic client to see how this works under the hood

## Using Google-A2A's cli tool

Note: This will only work if you've installed google-a2a from this [pull request](https://github.com/google/A2A/pull/169) as the cli was not exposed previously.

```bash
uv run google-a2a-cli
```

You can then send messages to your server and pressing Enter

```bash

```

To exit press Ctrl-C twice


## Writing our own cli

Coming Soon!
