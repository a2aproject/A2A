a2a.utils.telemetry module
**************************

OpenTelemetry Tracing Utilities for A2A Python SDK.

This module provides decorators to simplify the integration of
OpenTelemetry tracing into Python applications. It offers
*trace_function* for instrumenting individual functions (both
synchronous and asynchronous) and *trace_class* for instrumenting
multiple methods within a class.

The tracer is initialized with the module name and version defined by
*INSTRUMENTING_MODULE_NAME* ('a2a-python-sdk') and
*INSTRUMENTING_MODULE_VERSION* ('1.0.0').

Features: - Automatic span creation for decorated functions/methods. -
Support for both synchronous and asynchronous functions. - Default
span naming based on module and function/class/method name. -
Customizable span names, kinds, and static attributes. - Dynamic
attribute setting via an *attribute_extractor* callback. - Automatic
recording of exceptions and setting of span status. - Selective method
tracing in classes using include/exclude lists.

Configuration: - Environment Variable Control: OpenTelemetry
instrumentation can be

   disabled using the *OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_A2A_SDK_ENABLED*
   environment variable.

   * Default: *true* (tracing enabled when OpenTelemetry is installed)

   * To disable: Set *OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_A2A_SDK_ENABLED=false*

   * Case insensitive: 'true', 'True', 'TRUE' all enable tracing

   * Any other value disables tracing and logs a debug message

Usage:
   For a single function: >>``<<>>`<<python from your_module import
   trace_function

   @trace_function def my_function():

      # ... pass

   @trace_function(span_name='custom.op', kind=SpanKind.CLIENT) async
   def my_async_function():

      # ... pass

   >>``<<>>`<<

   For a class: >>``<<>>`<<python from your_module import trace_class

   @trace_class(exclude_list=['internal_method']) class MyService:

      def public_api(self, user_id):
         # This method will be traced pass

      def internal_method(self):
         # This method will not be traced pass

   >>``<<>>`<<

class a2a.utils.telemetry.SpanKind(*values)

   Bases: "Enum"

   Specifies additional details on how this span relates to its parent
   span.

   Note that this enumeration is experimental and likely to change.
   See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-
   specification/pull/226.

   CLIENT = 2

      Indicates that the span describes a request to some remote
      service.

   CONSUMER = 4

      Indicates that the span describes a consumer receiving a message
      from a broker. Unlike client and server, there is usually no
      direct critical path latency relationship between producer and
      consumer spans.

   INTERNAL = 0

   PRODUCER = 3

      Indicates that the span describes a producer sending a message
      to a broker. Unlike client and server, there is usually no
      direct critical path latency relationship between producer and
      consumer spans.

   SERVER = 1
