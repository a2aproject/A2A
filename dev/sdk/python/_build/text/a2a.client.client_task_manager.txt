*************************************

class a2a.client.client_task_manager.ClientTaskManager

   Bases: "object"

   Helps manage a task's lifecycle during execution of a request.

   Responsible for retrieving, saving, and updating the *Task* object
   based on events received from the agent.

   get_task() -> Task | None

      Retrieves the current task object, either from memory.

      If *task_id* is set, it returns *_current_task* otherwise None.

      Returns:
         The *Task* object if found, otherwise *None*.

   get_task_or_raise() -> Task

      Retrieves the current task object.

      Returns:
         The *Task* object.

      Raises:
         **A2AClientInvalidStateError** -- If there is no current
         known Task.

   async process(event: Message | Task | TaskStatusUpdateEvent | TaskArtifactUpdateEvent) -> Message | Task | TaskStatusUpdateEvent | TaskArtifactUpdateEvent

      Processes an event, updates the task state if applicable, stores
      it, and returns the event.

      If the event is task-related (*Task*, *TaskStatusUpdateEvent*,
      *TaskArtifactUpdateEvent*), the internal task state is updated
      and persisted.

      Parameters:
         **event** -- The event object received from the agent.

      Returns:
         The same event object that was processed.

   async save_task_event(event: Task | TaskStatusUpdateEvent | TaskArtifactUpdateEvent) -> Task | None

      Processes a task-related event (Task, Status, Artifact) and
      saves the updated task state.

      Ensures task and context IDs match or are set from the event.

      Parameters:
         **event** -- The task-related event (*Task*,
         *TaskStatusUpdateEvent*, or *TaskArtifactUpdateEvent*).

      Returns:
         The updated *Task* object after processing the event.

      Raises:
         **ClientError** -- If the task ID in the event conflicts with
         the TaskManager's ID     when the TaskManager's ID is already
         set.

   update_with_message(message: Message, task: Task) -> Task

      Updates a task object adding a new message to its history.

      If the task has a message in its current status, that message is
      moved to the history first.

      Parameters:
         * **message** -- The new *Message* to add to the history.

         * **task** -- The *Task* object to update.

      Returns:
         The updated *Task* object (updated in-place).
