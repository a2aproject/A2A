Client and server classes corresponding to protobuf-defined services.

class a2a.grpc.a2a_pb2_grpc.A2AService

   Bases: "object"

   A2AService defines the gRPC version of the A2A protocol. This has a
   slightly different shape than the JSONRPC version to better conform
   to AIP-127, where appropriate. The nouns are AgentCard, Message,
   Task and TaskPushNotificationConfig. - Messages are not a standard
   resource so there is no get/delete/update/list interface, only a
   send and stream custom methods. - Tasks have a get interface and
   custom cancel and subscribe methods. - TaskPushNotificationConfig
   are a resource whose parent is a task. They have get, list and
   create methods. - AgentCard is a static resource with only a get
   method.

class a2a.grpc.a2a_pb2_grpc.A2AServiceServicer

   Bases: "object"

   A2AService defines the gRPC version of the A2A protocol. This has a
   slightly different shape than the JSONRPC version to better conform
   to AIP-127, where appropriate. The nouns are AgentCard, Message,
   Task and TaskPushNotificationConfig. - Messages are not a standard
   resource so there is no get/delete/update/list interface, only a
   send and stream custom methods. - Tasks have a get interface and
   custom cancel and subscribe methods. - TaskPushNotificationConfig
   are a resource whose parent is a task. They have get, list and
   create methods. - AgentCard is a static resource with only a get
   method.

   CancelTask(request, context)

      Cancel a task from the agent. If supported one should expect no
      more task updates for the task.

   CreateTaskPushNotificationConfig(request, context)

      Set a push notification config for a task.

   DeleteTaskPushNotificationConfig(request, context)

      Delete a push notification config for a task.

   GetAgentCard(request, context)

      GetAgentCard returns the agent card for the agent.

   GetTask(request, context)

      Get the current state of a task from the agent.

   GetTaskPushNotificationConfig(request, context)

      Get a push notification config for a task.

   ListTaskPushNotificationConfig(request, context)

      Get a list of push notifications configured for a task.

   SendMessage(request, context)

      Send a message to the agent. This is a blocking call that will
      return the task once it is completed, or a LRO if requested.

   SendStreamingMessage(request, context)

      SendStreamingMessage is a streaming call that will return a
      stream of task update events until the Task is in an interrupted
      or terminal state.

   TaskSubscription(request, context)

      TaskSubscription is a streaming call that will return a stream
      of task update events. This attaches the stream to an existing
      in process task. If the task is complete the stream will return
      the completed task (like GetTask) and close the stream.

   method.
