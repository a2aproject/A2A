****************************************

class a2a.server.apps.rest.rest_adapter.RESTAdapter(agent_card: AgentCard, http_handler: RequestHandler, extended_agent_card: AgentCard | None = None, context_builder: CallContextBuilder | None = None, card_modifier: Callable[[AgentCard], Awaitable[AgentCard] | AgentCard] | None = None, extended_card_modifier: Callable[[AgentCard, ServerCallContext], Awaitable[AgentCard] | AgentCard] | None = None)

   Bases: "object"

   Adapter to make RequestHandler work with RESTful API.

   Defines REST requests processors and the routes to attach them too,
   as well as manages response generation including Server-Sent Events
   (SSE).

   async handle_authenticated_agent_card(request: Request, call_context: ServerCallContext | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]

      Hook for per credential agent card response.

      If a dynamic card is needed based on the credentials provided in
      the request override this method and return the customized
      content.

      Parameters:
         * **request** -- The incoming Starlette Request  object.

         * **call_context** -- ServerCallContext

      Returns:
         A JSONResponse containing the authenticated card.

   async handle_get_agent_card(request: Request, call_context: ServerCallContext | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]

      Handles GET requests for the agent card endpoint.

      Parameters:
         * **request** -- The incoming Starlette Request object.

         * **call_context** -- ServerCallContext

      Returns:
         A JSONResponse containing the agent card data.

   routes() -> dict[tuple[str, str], Callable[[Request], Any]]

      Constructs a dictionary of API routes and their corresponding
      handlers.

      This method maps URL paths and HTTP methods to the appropriate
      handler functions from the RESTHandler. It can be used by a web
      framework (like Starlette or FastAPI) to set up the
      application's endpoints.

      Returns:
         A dictionary where each key is a tuple of (path, http_method)
         and the value is the callable handler for that route.
